# Site comparisons (Derek & Kristie)


__Notes__

Steps:  

- Chart data with box and whisker plots. Some site differences might be very apparent and not require statistical comparisons. [Need to think about what is apparent enough for a visual test, maybe no overlap of box, or only half or less overlap] look at cenboxplot with NADA packages, or use Kristies boxplot with censored values.
- Check for normality Chi-squared test (Is normality a valid assumption?). If the data are normal, and there is equal variance [Levenes test--generic script here] complete an ANOVA to compare sites. If there are more than 2 sites, follow with a post hoc test [I say Tukey, but Derek weigh in here].
- If the data are not normal, and there is not equal variance [see generic script from above] complete a Kruskal wallis test (but there are other ones if you have < or > 50 samplesâ€¦look into this). If there are more than 2 sites to compare, use Dunns test for post hoc site by site comparisons [Kristie has a script for this, will make it generic]. 
- Bayesian ANOVA?  [Derek likes this!]


## Confidence intervals 

Some _significant_ applications are demonstrated in this chapter.
