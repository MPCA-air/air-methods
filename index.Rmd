This guide describes the methods used at the MPCA to analyze air monitoring and modeling data. The charts and code found in this guide were produced using the freely available R statistical software. To follow along with the examples, you can download a copy of R to your computer from the [r-project](https://cran.r-project.org/) or by using [R-Fiddle](http://www.r-fiddle.org/#/) in your browser.
