Three important errors to track are loss of sample (leaks), intrument issues (concing in duplicated concs), or extreme values (high values). Recommended steps Identify exceptionally high values. Identify 3 sequential identical values. Identify potential instrument drift. Report findings to laboratory for further investigation. Why not average these exceptional data into the year and assume the problem will go away? Further investigation by laboratory staff is required if the laboratory equipment or system is in error. If the laboratory is not in error, these concs require additional investigation by data analysts and potentially by air pollution source specialists. For these reasons, these data validation steps are critical. A decreasing signal or repeated sequential measurement means that the data are not interpretable. An exceptionally high value could mean laboratory contamination or potentially could contribute to human health impacts if the high value is accurate.

The test looks for a difference in variance of carbon tetrachloride between a calendar quarter for two consecutive years. Carbon tetrachloride was chosen because it is a banned substance and no longer in use, it has very few below detection limit values, and no direct sources. It has seasonally variable concentrations, so calendar quarters were compared to eliminate the detection of seasonal differences. The statistical test used was a Levenes Test for homogeneity of variance. 2.1 Exceptional and extreme values aka outliers are detected by comparing each measured concentration to 3 X the 75th percentile of the data set by year, site, and pollutant.

None in PAHs. Approximately 3200 for UFPs, but this is 15 minute data. We may need a more stringent test for UFPs.
