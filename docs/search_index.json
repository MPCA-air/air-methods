["best-practices.html", " Best practices 1.1 Tidyverse 1.2 Pollutant names 1.3 Keeping R up-to-date 1.4 Script layout 1.5 Divide and conquer", " Best practices This section includes some best practices to promote consistent, efficient, and accurate data analysis with R. 1.1 Tidyverse The Tidyverse consists of a group of R packages that work in harmony by sharing a common data format and syntax. Using packages within the Tidyverse for your analysis will make your scripts easier to read for others and future you. 1.2 Pollutant names Pollutants often go by different names depending on the context you’re in. To prevent confusion it helps to include a unique CAS # or parameter code in your analysis results and summary data. If you are working with monitoring data that is missing a unique identifier for each pollutant, an R package named aircas is available to help join CAS numbers to pollutant names. 1.3 Keeping R up-to-date Get the installr package install.packages(&#39;installr&#39;) library(&#39;installr&#39;) Install the new R version updateR() When a popup suggests closing RStudio and running the update from RGUI, click NO. When asked whether to copy and update all of your packages. Click Yes. This will save you heaps of time and prevent future headaches. To learn more about installr see https://github.com/talgalili/installr/#readme. 1.4 Script layout The following tips will help make your R scripts easier to read and easier for others to use your code in their own projects. Add a description to the top of your script. Load all your packages in one block at the top of the script. Assign important file paths and parameters near the top of the script. Avoid changing working directories with setwd(). Load usernames and passwords from a file such as credentials.csv. Save files to a local working directory such as &quot;~\\results.csv&quot;, rather than to a fixed location, such as X:\\EAO\\Air Data\\Project1\\results.csv. Here is an example script layout: # name_of_script.R # Purpose: This script does amazing things. # Assumptions: The monitoring data for the sites is from different years, # but we compare them anyways. # Warning! Don&#39;t use this script for Kryptonite. It will break everything. # Load packages library(dplyr) library(readr) # Set parameters year &lt;- 2017 data_file &lt;- &quot;monitors 1 and 2.csv&quot; # Load data air_data &lt;- read_csv(data_file) # My functions calc_stat &lt;- function(data) { new_stat &lt;- step1(data) %&gt;% step2() %&gt;% step3() } # My analysis results &lt;- air_data %&gt;% summarize(stat = calc_stat(concentration)) # Save results to local folder write_csv(results, &quot;results/summary_results.csv&quot;) 1.5 Divide and conquer For complex analysis projects many small components are often better than one big super script. As much as possible, try to create small functions to perform each task within in your analysis. If it’s a function that you will use across multiple projects, it is often helpful to save the function to it’s own script. These functions will become reusable building blocks that both future you and others can apply to their own projects. Using an R Markdown document is an additional way you can split your project into manageable steps. R Markdown makes it easier to include a short description of each step of your analysis. In fact, you are reading an R Markdown document now. An example folder structure for a project is shown below: New_Project\\ data monitors 1 and 2.csv R load_data.R calc_ucl95.R lil_boot_function.R summary_report.RMD results summary_results.csv summary_report.pdf "],

The LIMS system is being retired and replaced. To ease data accessibilty during this transition LIMS data are available for download via an internal Tableau workbook at http://tableau.pca.state.mn.us/#/workbooks/3342. 2.1.6 Retrieving continuous data from AirVision AirVision is the data acquistion and temporary storage database for continuous air monitoring data. Data collected in AirVision is transfered to LIMs and AQS for final data storage. If you need to access to continuous data before it has been transfered to the final data repository you can run reports from AirVision. To run reports, the AirVision client must be installed on your computer and you need an user account. Contact the Air Monitoring Supervisor to request credentials. Alternatively, an AirVision administator can create a report task that will generate a data report and send it to a specified location (FTP site or e-mail). 2.1.7 Retrieving data from MPCA WAIR database The WAIR database provides a queryable local copy of select air quality data extracted from multiple data sources. This database is managed by Margaret McCourtney. Contact Margaret to request login credentials. See WAIR Data Dictionary for available data tables.

Ambient air quality standards are set at the national (NAAQS) and state (MAAQS) level. NAAQS The Clean Air Act, which was last amended in 1990, requires EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (40 CFR part 50) for pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment. The Clean Air Act identifies two types of national ambient air quality standards. Primary standards provide public health protection, including protecting the health of “sensitive” populations such as asthmatics, children, and the elderly. Secondary standards provide public welfare protection, including protection against decreased visibility and damage to animals, crops, vegetation, and buildings. A summary of current NAAQS is available on EPA’s website: https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants/naaqs-table When calculating NAAQS design values, analysts must follow the procedures defined in the pollutant specific appendices to 40 CFR 50. In August each year, EPA posts official design values here: https://www.epa.gov/air-trends/air-quality-design-values MAAQS Minnesota Ambient Air Quality Standards (MAAQS) are established in Minnesota Administrative Rules 7009. In most cases, the MAAQS are the same as the NAAQS. The MAAQS also include standards for two pollutants that are not covered by the NAAQS: TSP and hydrogen sulfide. The MAAQS were last updated in January 2017. When calculating MAAQS design values: If MAAQS = NAAQS, use methods described in appendices to 40 CFR 50. If MAAQS = revoked NAAQS, use methods described in archived appendices to 40 CFR 50. For MAAQS without a NAAQS, such as H2S, use the “Form of the standard” language to guide your calculations. 2.3 Air modeling 2.3.1 NATA modeling The National Air Toxics Assessment is a nationwide air modeling effort to provide air concentrations and risks for all U.S. census tracts. These results may be pulled from a map project or data tables at this website: https://www.epa.gov/national-air-toxics-assessment. After each inventory is completed the Minnesota statewide cumulative air pollution model is compared to these results. 2.3.2 MNRISKS statewide risk modeling MNRISKS is the statewide cumulative air pollution model that is produced by MPCA every three years with the air toxics emissions inventory publication. The model itself produces point estimates for air concentrations and potential human health risks for hundreds of air pollutants across Minnesota. The model also incorporates a date and transport component that produces multi-pathway risk results. Census block group averaged results are available on the MPCA webpage in the following location: https://www.pca.state.mn.us/air/air-modeling-and-human-health. 2.3.3 Downscaler modeling results for Ozone and PM2.5 Downscaled data (a blend of modeling and monitoring results) are provided by the CDC in cooperation with the EPA for the pollutants ozone and PM-2.5. Daily predicitons are available for each Census tract throughout the country for the years 2001 to 2013. CDC information about this platform is available online at https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/showAirData.action Data from this platform can be downloaded from the EPA at https://www.epa.gov/air-research/downscaler-model-predicting-daily-air-pollution. Downloaded data filtered to Minnesota results is available internally in the data folder: X:\\Programs\\Air_Quality_Programs\\Air Monitoring Data and Risks\\6 Air Data\\EPA Downscaler Modeling. 2.3.4 CMAQ Ozone modeling The Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling System (CMAQ) is defined by EPA as: CMAQ (see-mak): an active open-source development project of the EPA that consists of a suite of programs for conducting air quality model simulations. CMAQ combines current knowledge in atmospheric science and air quality modeling, and an open-source framework to deliver fast, technically sound estimates of ozone, particulates, air toxics and acids deposition. The information and data from this platform can be found at the following website https://www.epa.gov/cmaq. 2.4 Context 2.4.1 MN Emissions Inventory Every year all facilities (stationary point sources) report criteria pollutant emissions and every three years facilities report air toxics emissions. The EPA and the state of Minnesota emissions inventory team also calculate and report emissions for all other types of emissions sources such as mobile, non-road mobile, and area sources. These non-point emissions are reported every three years with the air toxics emissions. The Minnesota emission inventory is the foundation of MNRISKS. These emissions levels are reported in several data tools on the MPCA website. Their data and the visualization tools can be found on the following website https://www.pca.state.mn.us/air/emissions-data. 2.4.2 EPA’s NEI The National Emissions Inventory (NEI) provides air toxics and criteria and air toxic pollutant emissions for the entire U.S. on the same schedule as described in the Minnesota Emissions Inventory section. This information can be found at the following website https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-inventories/national-emissions-inventory-nei. 2.4.3 Facility locations The most recent compilation of facility coordinates was performed for the 2017 emission inventory. This data is available in the INV_SOURCES table found in the RAPIDS schema within MPCA’s DELTA database. Use the following code to load the current facility coordinates.

These data may come in a raw unprocessd format or be pre-cleaned and quality controlled for machine errors. An internal Tableau workbook provides raw results for Minnesota meteorological stations: tableau.pca.state.mn.us/#/workbooks/5714. The AQI forecast uses a web API provided by DarkSky for current forecast information and quality assurred historical observations. 2.4.5 HYSPLIT wind trajectories Wind trajectories are useful for determining the primary sources contributing to elevated monitoring results.

These procedures include steps to: 3.1 Remove blank, invalid, NULL, and missing values 3.2 Evaluate qualified data 3.3 Remove duplicate observations 3.1 Blank, NULL, and missing values Description Large monitoring data sets often contain observations with missing concentrations, detection limits or other non-instrument result entries that can lead to incorrect summary statistics. Recommended steps Identify any blank, NULL, -999, and missing values. If available, review Null Data Codes. These codes will tell you why the data is missing. Most data sets will include null data codes. For AQS null code descriptions, see https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/codetables/qualifiers.html. Determine if your analysis needs to account for missing data before deleting observations. You may want to perform a count on all sample dates to quantify the expected number of observations. If you no longer need these records, remove them from the dataset. Document your process. Wait, you did that by writing it in an R script. Why not keep them? In most cases, our analyses do not require or allow filling in missing values. For this reason, it makes sense to remove them. However, for some analyses you may want to fill the missing values. The method for filling values will be project specific and decisions should be documented. Data sets should identify any records that include a replaced missing value.

These qualifiers provide contextual information about factors that can influence results. In the AQS data format, qualifiers are listed in 10 qualifier fields. A sample may have more than one qualifier. Descriptions of the AQS qualifier codes are available from the EPA at https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/codetables/qualifiers.html. Recommended steps Filter data to view samples with Qualifier codes Evaluate whether any of the qualified data will unduly influence your analysis. For example, you may want to remove samples influenced by unique events. When removing qualified data, maintain a copy of the original data set and document what values have been removed. In some cases, you may want to run your analysis with and without the qualified values to characterize the influence of the qualified data on the results. &lt; Sample R script Click the button below to view a step by step example of the methods above. Show R code ## NULL 3.3 Duplicate observations Description Large monitoring data sets often contain multiple observations from the same monitor for the same time period. When multiple observations do occur they tend to be identified by or by a qualifier describing why the second observation was recorded (e.g. a duplicate for quality control). The treatment of these duplicate values will depend on the analysis. Recommended steps Identify duplicate observations. A duplicate in the data is likely the result of an error. Consult the lab about duplicate values. Treatment of a duplicate observation will depend on the project. For criteria pollutant design values, treatment of duplicate samples is defined for each pollutant in the Appendices of 40 CFR 50. For air toxics, treatment of duplicate values will depend on the analysis. In some cases you may want to average the results. In others, you may want to take the maximum value. If you identify records that are completely duplicated (same date, same site, same POC, same result, same MDL), delete these records prior to completing analyses. For automated annual summaries, use the following hierarchy to remove duplicates: Calculate the mean concentration of all non-censored observations. If all observations are censored, select the observation with the lowest detection limit. If all observations are censored and the detection limits are equal, select a single observation. Why not keep all the data? Leaving multiple observations for some dates in the data set is likely to bias calculated summary statistics. For example, duplicate ozone observations from January would be likely to skew the annual average lower. By limiting the number of observations to 1 per day, we can remove the bias due to duplicate observations. Sample R script Click the button below to view a step by step example of the methods above.

One way to catch these errors is to complete routines to find data that are inconsistent with expectations or do not comply with data rules. Data validation tasks should be completed at a scheduled frequency depending on the data frequency and the resources available. Some important errors to check for include: 4.1 Leaks, instrument drift, and sample contamination 4.2 Outliers and extreme values 4.3 Sequential repeats and sticky numbers 4.4 Unique values There are other potential validation steps that may be done for specific sets of pollutants. The description of these methods in this web book are in development. Why not average the exceptional data over the year? Further investigation by laboratory staff is required if the laboratory equipment or system is in error. If the laboratory is not in error, these concentrations require additional investigation by data analysts and potentially by air pollution source specialists. For these reasons, these data validation steps are critical. A decreasing signal or repeated sequential measurement means that the data are not interpretable. An exceptionally high value could mean laboratory contamination or potentially could contribute to human health impacts if the high value is accurate. Basic validation tests Identify potential instrument drift. Find low values where this is not common. Identify exceptional values. Find extreme values that may be in error or from contamination. Identify sequential identical values (sticking). Test - Find 3 repeating values that are exactly the same. Report findings to laboratory for further investigation.

Shiny Data tool 4.1 Instrument drift or leaks in a system. The example test set up to detect intrument drift checks for a difference in variance of carbon tetrachloride between a calendar quarter for two consecutive years. This test works for VOC air toxics measurements only. Carbon tetrachloride was chosen because it is a banned substance and no longer in use, it has very few below detection limit values, and no direct sources. It has seasonally variable concentrations, so calendar quarters were compared to eliminate the detection of seasonal differences. The statistical test used was a Levenes Test for homogeneity of variance. This test could be applied to other surrogate compounds where there are multiple analytes, or could be applied to single measurements when there is only one analyte for the instrument in questions (i.e. PM2.5).

For now, collocated measurements (POCS) are not tested separately. For data with higher temporal variability, such as black carbon and ultrafine particulates, a criteria of 3 x the 95th percentile of the data set by year, site and pollutant should be used. The criteria for exceptional values was designed to balance sensitivity to actually find extremely high values with a limit to the number of extreme values that may be expected in a year of air monitoring. For example, most air pollution measurements are much higher during fire works, such as occurrs on July 4th and December 31st. These data are not in error, they are accurate representations of the air concentrations during those times. Sample R script Click the button to view a step by step example.

["collocated-monitors.html", " Collocated monitors 5.1 Evaluate collocated air monitors 5.2 Prioritize multiple air monitors (POCs)", " Collocated monitors Analysis steps for collocated monitors include: 5.1 Evaluate sites with collocated monitors 5.2 Prioritize observations from collocated monitors 5.1 Evaluate collocated air monitors Description Collocated samples are multiple samples taken for a pollutant from the same monitoring site at the same time. Collocated samples provide an extra layer of quality assurance by taking multiple measurements under very similar conditions which helps detect machine, lab, and human error. Depending on the results from collocated monitors, only one of the monitors, or potentially neither may be considered as valid measurements. Why not keep all the data? Leaving observations for multiple POCs in the data set is likely to bias calculated summary statistics. For example, consider a site that starts with two monitors operating during the winter months, but after one malfunctions, the site is left with one monitor operating for the remainder of the year. If we were to calculate the annual average for this site, the mean would be biased by having twice as many observations during the winter months. By limiting the number of observations to 1 per day, we can remove the bias due to the extra winter observations. Recommended steps Viewing a scatterplot of collocated measurements is suggested as it helps to view both obvious and subtle irregularities between collocated measurements. If there is evidence of bias in one of the monitors (values from one collocated monitor are usually higher than the other), or there is large variance between the collocated monitors (values differ from each other by significant margins), then both collocated monitors need to be investigated further. EPA recommends that collocated monitors have no higher than a 15% coefficient of variation between their measurements. Calculating the CV for every measurement pair does not make sense as small differences (i.e. 0.001 and 0.002) have the same CV as large differences (i.e. 10 and 20). Therefore, we chose to look at the median CV for each site, pollutant, and year then flag collocated monitors if the median CV is greater than 15 which suggests differences between the collocated monitors are systematic. We only calculate the CV for collocated monitors on days which both have valid measurements greater than or equal to the MDL since there is lower confidence in values below the MDL. We only compare the median CV to the threshold of 15 if there are at least 10 calculated CV values since it does not make sense to flag monitors where only a few values are above detection. If collocated monitors do not agree, then consult with the lab, field or quality assurance team to determine if there is a problem with one of the POCs. If they determine that one of POCs is reliable and the other is not, then only use data from the reliable POC. If they cannot determine which POC is the problem, then confidence in the measurements from both collocated monitors is reduced and * no measurements taken from either collocated monitor should be used.* More than likely, we will be asked to report results. We will have lower confidence in the accuracy of those results Sample R script The function POC_compare below generates scatterplots comparing sample values from POC 1 and POC 2 for sites with collocated monitors. If most points on the scatterplot are close to the red line and the correlation is high, then measurements from both POCs are considered equally valid. If points are not close to the red line or the correlation is not high, then both POCs need to be investigated to determine if one POC is more relaible.

Recommended steps For air toxics, measurements from collocated monitors are considered equally valid unless there is a specific reason to treat them differently. Therefore, these methods are used for dealing with collocated samples where the POCs generally provide similar results. If one monitor has a valid measurement, and the other does not, then the valid measurement is used. If one monitor has a valid measurement greater than or equal to the MDL and the other has a valid measurement less than the MDL, then the measurement above the MDL is used as a conservative approach as there is greater confidence in the value above the MDL. If both monitors have valid measurements above the MDL, then those values are averaged since both values are equally valid and the “true” value is assumed to likely be between the two values.

Begining in 2017, the lab adopted a modified method for calcuating the method detection limit. Known as the “Method Update Rule(MUR)”, this method accounts for media background contamination when establishing the MDL. This method is defined in the NATTS TAD (October 2016). EPA has proposed to revise 40 CFR Appendix B to Part 136 to reflect this methodology. Both methods require preparing and analyzing 7 matrix spikes and 7 method blanks. Samples should be prepped and analyzed over the course of at least 3 seperate batches/days. Calculate the MDL of spiked samples (MDL_sp) Calculate standard deviation of the calcuated concentrations for the spiked samples. Calculate the MDL for the spiked samples by multiplying the standard deviation of spiked sample by the one-sided student’s T value at 99% confidence corresponding to the number of spikes analyzed (3.143 if 7 samples). New method requires calculation of the MDL of the method blanks (MDL_b). If no method blank provides a numerical result, no further action needed. If method blank pool includes a combination of ND and numeric values, set the method blank MDL to equal the highest of the method blank results. If all concentration values for the method blank pool are numeric values, calculate the MDL_b as follows: Calculate the average concentration of method blanks Calculate the standard deviation of the method blank concentrations Multiply the standard deviation by the one-sided student’s T value at 99% confidence corresponding to the number of blanks analyzed Calculate the MDL_b as the sum of the average concentration method blanks, and the product of the standard deviation of blanks and the associated student’s T Value MDL_b = mean_blanks + stdv_blanks * Student T Compare MDL_sp and MDL_b. The higher of the two values is reported as the laboratory MDL. 6.3 Finding MPCA detection limits Annual method detection limits used for data analysis are stored on the X-drive at X:\\Databases\\AQ\\AQ Lab\\Data Analysis\\Air Toxics\\Detection Limits\\Annual Detection Limits (micrograms).xlsx Use the ParamYear field to join monitoring observations to their respective detection limits. Detection limits are updated when received from the lab. Current year samples may not have a detection limit in the file if the lab has not performed the test. If you receive a detection limit from the lab it is likely in “instrument units”. Metals (ug/mL): conversion to ug/m3 requires accounting of flow rate, runtime, and 1/9 filter strip, and 40 mL liquid extraction Carbonyls (ug/mL): conversion requires account of flow rate, runtime, and extraction volume. VOCs (ppb):conversion can be done using MW and Standard Temp/Pressure. When Promium is adopted, method detection limits will be applied on a sample basis and will account for the varying air volumes of samples. As a result, there will be multiple detection limits for an analyte. 6.4 Qualifier Codes for Detection Limits Begining in 2017, the MPCA will be linking laboratory detection limits to sample data and applying appropriate data qualifiers depending on detection status. These qualifiers include: ND HAP not qualitatively identified (reported as zero) MD &lt; MDL SQ &gt;= MDL but &lt; SQL No qualifier measured concentration &gt;= to SQL The SQL is 3.18x the MDL 6.5 Estimating below detection values (what not to do) Don’t delete data. Deleting data that are below a detection limit biases central tendency estimates and whole data summaries (quantiles of the data set) high. Don’t fill with zeros Substituting below detection limit data with 0’s biases central tendency estimates and whole data summaries (quantiles of the data set) low, and can change the distribution by the creation of multiple same value numbers, and can even create an inaccurate bimodal distribution of the data. Don’t fill with DLs or ½ DLs Substituting below detection limit data with 1/2 MDL creates the least bias in central tendency estimates and whole data summaries (quantiles of the data set), however, it can change the distribution by the creation of multiple same value numbers, and can even create an inaccurate bimodal distribution of the data. Substituting below detection limit data with MDLs biases central tendency estimates and whole data summaries (quantiles of the data set) high, and can change the distribution by the creation of multiple same value numbers, and can even create an inaccurate bimodal distribution of the data. 6.6 Below detection values Recommended Steps 24-hour samples which are below the method detection limit should be noted as “Censored” and the machine values should not be reported to the public unless explicitly requested. It is advised to replace the machine value with note, such as MDL, so the machine value is not used in independent analysis and to alert users of the data that censored values exist in the monitoring results. For details on how to deal with censored values in calculating annual summaries, see the summary methods section.

Below is the code for how to resample a single site. # Filter data to a single site df_site1 &lt;- filter(df, AQS_ID == AQS_ID[1]) # Pull random sample # `replace=T` allows for the same value to be pulled multiple times # `size=nrow(df)` ensures the number of observations in the new table to match the original random_df &lt;- sample(df_site1$Conc, replace = T) # Generate summary statistic quantile(random_df, 0.1) ## 10% ## 0.00064 To repeat this 3,000 times we can wrap these steps into a resample function, and then use sapply to collect the results. # Create resample function resample_Conc &lt;- function(data = df_site1$Conc, Conc_pct = 0.10){ random_df &lt;- sample(data, replace = T) quantile(random_df, Conc_pct, na.rm=T)[[1]] } # Repeat using `sapply` repeats &lt;- 3000 booted_10pct &lt;- sapply(1:repeats, FUN=function(x) resample_Conc(df_site1$Conc)) # The 50th percentile or median Conc median(booted_10pct, na.rm=T) ## [1] 0.00064 # Return the 95th percentile of the booted concentrations quantile(booted_10pct, 0.95, na.rm=T)[[1]] ## [1] 0.00148 # Force the 95th percentile to be a recorded value sort(booted_10pct)[repeats*.95 +1] ## [1] 0.00148 # Upper and lower confidence interval around the median quantile(booted_10pct, c(0.025, 0.5, 0.975), na.rm=T) ## 2.5% 50% 97.5% ## 0.000640 0.000640 0.103216 Automate To finish, put these steps into a boot function and run it on each site by using group_by. # Create boot function boot_low_Conc &lt;- function(data=df$Conc, Conc_pct=0.10, conf_int=0.95, repeats=3000){ alpha &lt;- (1 - conf_int)/2 booted_10pct &lt;- sapply(1:repeats, FUN=function(x) resample_Conc(data, Conc_pct)) # Upper and lower confidence interval around the median list(quantile(booted_10pct, c(alpha, 0.5, 1-alpha), na.rm=T)) } # Use `group_by` to send data for each site to your boot function conc_summary &lt;- group_by(df, AQS_ID) %&gt;% mutate(boot_results = boot_low_Conc(Conc, Conc_pct=0.10, conf_int=0.95)) %&gt;% summarize(Conc_10pct = quantile(Conc, 0.10, na.rm=T)[[1]], Low_CL95_conc = unlist(boot_results[1])[[1]], Boot_conc = unlist(boot_results[1])[[2]], Upper_CL95_conc = unlist(boot_results[1])[[3]]) Results The booted confidence limits: AQS_ID Conc_10pct Low_CL95_conc Boot_conc Upper_CL95_conc 270535501 0.000640 0.00064 0.000640 0.103216 270535502 0.000716 0.00044 0.000716 0.005214 8.3 Below the detection limit The annual mean or upper confidence limit is reported as below the detection limit when either of the following conditions is true: The number of censored values is greater than 80%. This is based on Cox 2006 and MPCA simulations (cite work and results)[www.google.com]. The annual mean or 95% upper confidence limit is below the method detection limit. 8.4 Upper confidence limits (UCLs) If data is not normal, use bootstraping to generate means for each site. The 95% upper confidence limit is the 95th percentile of means generated using bootstrap sampling. The script below uses bootstrap sampling to generate 1000 means for each site, pollutant, and year and then calculates the 95% UCL by taking the 95th percentile of those means. Values below the MDL are estimated using lognormal MLE estimation for each bootstrap sample. The 95% UCL is not calculated for any site, pollutant, and year which fails to meet completeness requirements and/or minimum detection requirements. Click the button below to view the code for calculating UCLs. Show R code 8.5 Annual summaries for incomplete data There may be situations when a monitoring site does not meet the 75 percent completeness requirement in each quarter of a year, but annual summary statistics are still necessary. In this case, calculate annual summary statistics as usual but note that the site did not meet completeness requirements. The minimum threshold of valid samples required for reporting any annual summary statistics at all is up to the judgement of data analysis staff. 8.6 Comparison of data to inhalation health benchmarks Chronic Inhalation Health Benchmarks - The annual 95% upper confidence limit is compared to chronic inhalation health benchmarks which are chosen based on the MPCA/MDH hierarchy for inhalation health benchmarks information sources.These risk results are summarized differently for annual measured data reports (The Air Toxics Data Explorer) or if the comparison is used in a cumulative analysis (cumulative AERA) to inform air permitting or environmental review. Acute Inhalation Health Benchmarks - The 2nd highest annual value multiplied by ten is compared to acute inhalation health benchmarks. This adjustment of the 24 hour integrated value approximates an hourly maximum, since acute inhalation health benchmarks are developed to be protective for high short-term exposures (about an hour). Summarization of risk estimates for a cumulative Air Emission Risk Analaysis - Risk estimates are summed across pollutants thereby applying the concept of additivity. Since not all pollutants are measured at each monitoring site, means of sites are estimated based on population density since we asumme that pollution sources are greater near greater numbers of people. Means are calculated for mid-density sites, and rural sites. Facilities within urban areas are provided risk estimates at the closest or most representative monitor with all pollutants measured. This is described in the cumulative AERA section in the AERA guidance. Cumulative AERAs use the mean cumulative risk estimates for the most recent three years of monitored data. 8.7 Rolling 365 day summaries Coming soon… "],
["site-comparisons.html", " Site comparisons 9.1 Confidence intervals 9.2 Tools to visualize data", " Site comparisons Notes Steps: Chart data with box and whisker plots. Some site differences might be very apparent and not require statistical comparisons. [Need to think about what is apparent enough for a visual test, maybe no overlap of box, or only half or less overlap] look at cenboxplot with NADA packages, or use Kristies boxplot with censored values. Check for normality Chi-squared test (Is normality a valid assumption?). If the data are normal, and there is equal variance [Levenes test–generic script here] complete an ANOVA to compare sites. If there are more than 2 sites, follow with a post hoc test [I say Tukey, but Derek weigh in here]. If the data are not normal, and there is not equal variance [see generic script from above] complete a Kruskal wallis test (but there are other ones if you have &lt; or &gt; 50 samples…look into this). If there are more than 2 sites to compare, use Dunns test for post hoc site by site comparisons [Kristie has a script for this, will make it generic]. 9.1 Confidence intervals If data is not normal, use bootstraping to generate means for each site and take the differences of those means. If the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for those differences is greater than zero, or the upper bound is less than zero, then the site means are significantly different. You cannot just genrate confidence intervals for the means individually and see if they overlap since the joint probability of both means being in the same region is lower than the marginal probabilities of each mean being in the region. It is not effective to do pairwise comparisons due to null data and non-detects. You cannot use an ANOVA test since the data more closely resembles a log-normal distribution than a normal distribution and for a log-normal distribution, the variance is not independent of the mean which means that transforming the data and doing an ANOVA test would bias the confidence interval for the difference. The script below uses bootstrap sampling to generate 1000 differences in site means which are ordered to create a 95% confidence interval for the difference in means. If the lower bound of the interval is greater than zero, then the second site has a higher mean concentration than the first site. If the upper bound of the confidence interval is less than zero, then the second site has a lower mean concentration than the first site. Click the button below to view example R script.

The length of each “paddle” is correlated with the percentage of days of valid measurements taken when the wind was blowing from that direction. So if the longest paddle is the one extending upward, then the wind blew from the North on average more times than any other direction for days with valid measurements of a pollutant.

Pollutant concentrations measured by air monitors help to quantify air quality and health risks. However, the results obtained from air monitors, also known as ambient air monitoring data, are not perfect. Air monitoring data often contains missing results for various reasons, erroneous values that may not reflect actual ambient air concentrations, and small values that cannot be reliably measured using current methods (non-detected values). Since monitoring data often has these irregularities, the MPCA has specific methods in place for analyzing air toxics data to account for irregularities (EPA has specific mandated practices for assessing criteria pollutants that are not covered in this document). This document explains the methods MPCA uses to analyze air toxics data. 17.1.1 Data Cleaning Null Results Any text values in the results column, such as null codes, are changed to blank cells. Any numeric results that appear to be placeholders for null values, such as 985 or -999, are changed to blank cells to reflect that they are null values. All values below the detection limit are left as-is during data cleaning, but are replaced with estimates later during analysis. Duplicate Observations If there are multiple results for a pollutant at the same site, time, and POC, then a single result must be selected for that site, time, and POC to avoid affecting summary statistics with extra samples which should not exist. The first step should be to consult the lab to determine why there is a duplicate observation and attempt to determine which one best reflects the conditions at the site and time. If consulting with the lab does not lead to a definitive conclusion for which result to keep, or if consulting with the lab is not a possibility, there these steps are recommended: If there is only one result greater than or equal to the detection limit (see information about method detection limits below), use that result. If there are multiple results greater than or equal to the detection limit, use the average of those results. If there are no results greater than or equal to the detection limit, use the result with the lowest detection limit. If all results have the same detection limit, then select any one of the results since it does not matter which one is selected. 17.1.2 Data Validation Monitoring results may be flagged for further review if there is a possibility that those values do not reflect actual ambient air concentrations. A flagged value is not immediately changed to null. Flagged values should be kept for all analysis until involved parties agree that they should be changed to null. Flagged values should only be removed without consultation if they significantly affect analysis results and there is a strong likelihood that those values do not accurately reflect actual ambient air concentrations at the site. When in doubt, keep flagged values as-is in all analysis. It is often a good idea to view a time series on monitoring results using software such as Tableau or R to spot irregularities in monitoring results that may be flagged immediately or after further review. Any values that appear extreme either on the high or low end are flagged for further investigation. Depending on feedback from the lab, QA, and/or air monitoring unit, flagged values may either be kept as-is or changed to blank if it is determined that those values are not appropriate to be included for the purpose of the analysis. Values which are equal in consecutive samples may be flagged depending on precision of the value and the number of consecutive samples with that value. For example, a value of 0.1234 in consecutive samples may be flagged for further review, but a value of 5 in consecutive samples for a method which produces values rounded to the nearest whole number may not be flagged unless that value is repeated in enough consecutive samples to be considered suspect. Flagging consecutive repeated values is a judgement call as to whether those values reflect no change in ambient air concentrations at a site, or whether those values likely represent the machine “sticking”. Other results which appear to not reflect ambient air concentrations may also be flagged. For example, a decreasing trend in results which may indicate a sample leak or calibration issue may also be flagged. 17.1.3 Parameter Occurrence Codes (POCs) Sometimes, there are multiple monitors at a site collecting samples for a pollutant. Each one of these monitors is assigned a POC. If there are multiple POCs at a site collecting samples at the same time, then a single result must be selected from those samples to avoid affecting summary statistics with extra samples caused by having multiple monitors at a site. The EPA recommends these steps for handling results from multiple POCs: If no results are valid, then the result for that time should be null. If there is only one valid result, use that result. If there is only one valid result greater than or equal to the detection limit, use that result. If there are multiple valid results greater than or equal to the detection limit, use the average of those results. If there are valid results, but none greater than or equal to the detection limit, then select the one with the lowest detection limit. If all results have the same detection limit, then use any result. 17.1.4 Producing Annual Summaries It is useful to calculate and report summary statistics for a calendar year such as a mean concentration or confidence interval for the mean concentration. Compilations of these summary statistics for reporting are referred to as “annual summaries”. Since ambient air monitoring data has results below detection limits, null results, and results that are flagged and removed, the reliability of annual summary statistics as a measure of true ambient air conditions can vary. Therefore, the MPCA has rules for analysis and reporting of air toxics for annual summaries that attempt to ensure all reported annual summary statistics approximately reflect true ambient air conditions at a site. Data Completeness For any summary statistic calculated from a sample, the reliability of that statistic improves as the sample size increases. Summary statistics calculated from small samples are not considered very reliable while summary statistics calculated from large samples are considered reliable. The MPCA has data completeness requirements so unreliable summary statistics are not reported. The EPA recommends that at least 75 percent of scheduled samples in a calendar year for a pollutant at a site produce a valid measurement (non-null result) in order to report summary statistics for the pollutant at that site. If fewer than 75 percent of scheduled samples in a calendar year produce a valid measurement, then annual summary statistics should not be reported for the pollutant at that site for that year. It may be reported that the summary statistic could not be calculated because this requirement was not met. EPA recommends that every 3-month quarter of a calendar year also have at least 75 percent of scheduled samples in that quarter produce a valid measurement. If any quarter of the year does not meet this requirement, then annual summary statistics should not be reported for the pollutant at that site for that year. It may be reported that the summary statistic could not be calculated because this requirement was not met. Results below the detection limit The precision of results below the detection limit is lower than the precision of results above the detection limit. However, there is strong confidence that monitor results below the detection limit indicate that the true ambient air concentration of a pollutant at the site is between zero and the method detection limit. The goal for values below the detection limit is to avoid making erroneous assumptions about values below the detection limit while still taking advantage of the information that they provide about ambient air concentrations. These are not recommended procedures for handling results below the detection limit Replace with blank cell. This treats results below the detection limit the same as null values and eliminates the useful information they provide. It generally biases annual summaries high. Replace with zero. While it is possible that the true ambient air concentration is zero, it is usually greater than zero. Replacing with zero biases summary statistics low. Replace with the detection limit. While it is possible that the true ambient air concentration is very close to the detection limit, it is often lower than the detection limit. Replacing with zero biases summary statistics low. Replace with half of the detection limit. This is considered a compromise between the two options above. It doesn’t bias summary statistics as much as the previous two options, but there are more sophisticated estimates for results below the detection limit which utilize results above the detection limit to help estimate results below the detection limit. The MPCA has elected to use maximum likelihood estimation to approximate values below the detection limit. The MPCA currently uses maximum likelihood estimation assuming a normal distribution for pollutant concentrations. For information about maximum likelihood estimation, visit . For information about why the MPCA uses maximum likelihood estimation instead of other non-detect estimation methods such as Kaplan Meier, visit . Maximum likelihood estimation requires a sufficient number of results above the detection limit in order to reliably estimate summary statistics. If more than 80 percent of results are below the detection limit, the estimates are unreliable. In that case, reliable annual summary statistics cannot be calculated and should not be reported. It may be reported that the summary statistic could not be calculated because there were not enough results above the detection limit. Maximum likelihood estimation also requires at least two results above the detection limit that are not equal. If there is one or no unique results above the detection limit, then maximum likelihood estimation cannot be used and annual summary statistics should not be reported. Calculating annual means In order to calculate an annual mean of an air toxic concentration, these criteria must be met as described above in data completeness and results below the detection limit: At least 75 percent of scheduled samples in the calendar year must produce a valid measurement. In addition, at least 75 percent of scheduled samples in each quarter must produce a valid measurement. At least 20 percent of valid samples must have a result equal to or greater than the detection limit. There must be at least two unique results above the detection limit. If any of these criteria are not met for a pollutant, then it is not recommended to report an annual mean for that pollutant. The annual mean for the concentration of a pollutant is the arithmetic mean of all samples in a calendar year after all null values are excluded and results below the detection limit are replaced with estimates using maximum likelihood estimation. Calculating upper confidence limits In order to calculate an upper confidence limit for the annual mean concentration of an air toxic, the same criteria required to calculate an annual mean for the concentration are also required to calculate an upper confidence limit. Nonparametric bootstrap sampling is used for calculating upper confidence limits since most air toxics data is not normally distributed. Information about bootstrapping can be found here: https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych252/tutorials/doBootstrapPrimer.pdf. At least 1,000 bootstrap samples should be taken, and a larger number of samples is better depending on the computation times. MPCA uses 95 percent upper confidence limits for comparisons to inhalation health benchmarks. Comparing site annual means There may be interest in comparing the annual means of a site over multiple years to determine if there is significant change over time or to compare the annuals means of multiple sites in a single year to determine if some sites have significantly higher concentrations of pollutants than others. MPCA uses this methodology to compare site means: MPCA does not use parametric methods for normally distrusted data such as t-tests since most air toxics data is not normally distributed. Pairwise comparisons of samples taken at different sites at the same time are not used since null values and values below the method detection limit make it difficult to perform pairwise comparisons across sites while still utilizing most of the samples collected. Bootstrap sampling is used to generate a confidence interval for the difference in annual means between years / sites. A confidence interval for the difference in annual means is generated instead of confidence intervals for each individual annual mean since the joint probability of two means being approximately the same is lower than the marginal probabilities of each mean existing in the other’s mean’s confidence interval. MPCA uses 95 percent two-sided confidence intervals for the difference in annual means. If the lower bound of the interval is greater than zero or the upper bound is less than zero, then there is a significant difference between the annual means. If the confidence interval includes zero, then there is no significant difference. "],
