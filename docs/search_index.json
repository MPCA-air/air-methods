These procedures include steps to: 1.1 Remove blank, NULL, and missing values 1.2 Evaluate qualified data 1.3 Remove duplicate observations 1.4 Prioritize observations from multiple monitors (POCs) 1.5 Evaluate outliers 1.1 Remove blank, NULL, and missing values Description Large monitoring data sets often contain observations with missing concentrations, detection limits or other labeling errors that can lead to incorrect summary statistics if not removed. Recommended steps Identify blank, NULL, -999, and missing values. Remove those observations. Why not keep them? Unless you can confirm what the missing values are meant to represent, such as observations below the detection limit, there is not an accurate means to determine the meaning of a missing value.

When multiples observations do occur they tend to be identified by a unique monitor POC (parameter occurrence code) or by a qualifier describing why the second observation was recorded (e.g. a duplicate for quality control). Recommended steps Identify duplicate observations. If both values are detected, calculate the mean of the duplicates. If values are identical, use the observation with a lower detection limit. Why not keep them all? If more data is more better, why not keep both values? Leaving both observations in the data set is likely to bias calculated summary statistics. For example, consider a scenario where two monitors were operating on a site during the winter months, but only one monitor was operating the rest of the year. If we were to calculate the annual average for this site using all the observations, the mean would be biased by having twice as many observations from the winter months. By limiting the number of observations to 1 per day, the weighting of the seasons will be balanced.

It has built in functions to accunt for non-detect data and allows for different distributions. However, if you’re not dealing with non-detects you can use a simple loop to boot things yourself. Before you start you’ll want to set the random number generator to ensure you’ll be able to reproduce your results. I’ll use #27 below. set.seed(27) The general idea is to take a random sample from the data set, generate the statistic that you’re interested in, record it, then rinse and repeat. Below is the code for how to resample a single site. # Filter data to a single site df_site1 &lt;- filter(df, AQS_ID == AQS_ID[1]) # Pull random sample # `replace=T` allows for the same value to be pulled multiple times # `size=nrow(df)` ensures the number of observations in the new table to match the original random_df &lt;- sample(df_site1$Conc, replace=T) # Generate summary statistic quantile(random_df, 0.1) ## 10% ## 0.00064 To repeat this 3,000 times we can wrap these steps into a resample function, and then use sapply to collect the results. # Create resample function resample_Conc &lt;- function(data= df_site1$Conc, Conc_pct= 0.10){ random_df &lt;- sample(data, replace=T) quantile(random_df, Conc_pct, na.rm=T)[[1]] } # Repeat using `sapply` repeats &lt;- 3000 booted_10pct &lt;- sapply(1:repeats, FUN=function(x) resample_Conc(df_site1$Conc)) # The 50th percentile or median Conc median(booted_10pct, na.rm=T) ## [1] 0.00064 # Return the 95th percentile of the booted concentrations quantile(booted_10pct, 0.95, na.rm=T)[[1]] ## [1] 0.00148 # Force the 95th percentile to be a recorded value sort(booted_10pct)[repeats*.95 +1] ## [1] 0.00148 # Upper and lower confidence interval around the median quantile(booted_10pct, c(0.025, 0.5, 0.975), na.rm=T) ## 2.5% 50% 97.5% ## 0.000640 0.000640 0.103216 Automate To finish up, throw these steps into your personal boot function, and then run it on each site using group_by. # Create boot function boot_low_Conc &lt;- function(data=df$Conc, Conc_pct=0.10, conf_int=0.95, repeats=3000){ alpha &lt;- (1 - conf_int)/2 booted_10pct &lt;- sapply(1:repeats, FUN=function(x) resample_Conc(data, Conc_pct)) # Upper and lower confidence interval around the median list(quantile(booted_10pct, c(alpha, 0.5, 1-alpha), na.rm=T)) } # Use `group_by` to send data for each site to your boot function conc_summary &lt;- group_by(df, AQS_ID) %&gt;% mutate(boot_results = boot_low_Conc(Conc, Conc_pct=0.10, conf_int=0.95)) %&gt;% summarize(Conc_10pct = quantile(Conc, 0.10, na.rm=T)[[1]], Low_CL95_conc = unlist(boot_results[1])[[1]], Boot_conc = unlist(boot_results[1])[[2]], Upper_CL95_conc = unlist(boot_results[1])[[3]]) Results The booted confidence limits AQS_ID Conc_10pct Low_CL95_conc Boot_conc Upper_CL95_conc 270535501 0.000640 0.00064 0.000640 0.103216 270535502 0.000716 0.00044 0.000716 0.005214 "],
