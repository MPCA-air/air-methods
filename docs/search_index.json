If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2017) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). ddd aaa 1.2 Multiple monitors (POCs) References "],
