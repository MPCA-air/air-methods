# Start to finish (all hands on deck) {#start-finish}


To pull it all together we created some R packages to streamline the cleaning and analysis steps. 


> `airclean`   Cleaning and analysis functions for air monitoring data. 
>
> `airplot`    Plotting functions for air monitoring data.
>
> `airrisk`    Inhalation health benchmarks for air toxics.


The script below shows an example workflow that starts with a raw data set from the lab, walks through each of the analysis steps outlined in the previous sections, and finishes by producing a summary PDF report.
