## Duplicate obersvations {#start}

You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference \@ref(start). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., \@ref(methods).

Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively.


You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015]. ddd aaa
